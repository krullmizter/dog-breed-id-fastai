        "# Dog Breed Identification built with Fast.ai's CNN using transfer learning\n",
        "---\n",
        "## Description\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will take on a dog breed identification challenge by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification). The challenge uses the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), which is a subset of the much larger [ImageNet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/). This notebook also serves as a technical guide, and specification for developing an open-source dog breed identification model using Python and [Fast.ai's](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook was created with the Stanford dataset in mind but the notebook can of course be used with other datasets as well. Feel free to modify the cells and code to fit your needs. This notebook servers as a guide and starting point for further development regarding Fast.ai and image classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook additionally explores the concepts of exploratory data analysis (EDA), data augmentation, image pre-processing, comprehensive logging of training statistics, the usage of libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib, the process of exporting, importing a trained model, and predicting new unseen images of dog breeds with the trained model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook also serves as the technical foundation for my bachelor's thesis on dog breed identification. The aim of this notebook, as well as my thesis, is to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of my model when compared to similar models trained on the Stanford Dogs Dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is quite extensively documented, and uses various comments, and text cells to explain the development process. This notebook is not as detailed as my thesis, do read the thesis if you want a more in-depth understanding of the subjects brought up in this notebook. The combination of this notebook, and my thesis creates a unified \"guide\" to doing image classification using Fast.ai's CNN. Feel free to comment, critique, and create your own version of this notebook.\n",

        "## Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of an image classification problem is to minimize the loss. Loss refers to the measure of how well a model's predictions match the actual classes/labels of the training data. A lower loss value indicates that the model is more accurate at making predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Striving for a high level of accuracy is also key. Accuracy is measured by how well the trained model can correctly predict the classes of unseen new images.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a broad overview of the main table of contents of this notebook:\n",

        "2.   Load the dataset\n",
        "3.   EDA\n",
        "4.   Dataloader\n",
        "5.   Training\n",
        "6.   Logging\n",
        "7.   Post-Training Analysis\n",
        "8.   Predictions\n",
        "9.   Export\n",
        "10.  Import trained model\n",
        "---\n",
        "## Technical Specifications\n",
        "Begin by downloading or cloning the public repo [GitHub](https://github.com/krullmizter/dog-breed-id-fastai).\n",
        "\n",
        "The GitHub repo contains an already created trained model directory, and two dog breed images. The existing directory and images are not needed during the training or testing, but they've been kept in the public repo to ease the development for myself, and when it came to the evaluation of my bachelor thesis, for which this notebook is a part of. You can either delete both the images, and the training folder when you start of on you own, or keep them as they are. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Remember to at least delete the `trained_model_stats.json` file in the training directory before you begin to log your own stats, otherwise my personal training stats will be apart of your training stats file!**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Setup\n",
        "In the chapter **Settings, Variables & Paths** there are several changeable variables that controls if certain cells will run or not. Go over them with care before doing any training or testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset\n",
        "This notebook will automatically download the Stanford dataset from my personal Google Drive, via a public link. But if you prefer you can [download](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data) the Stanford dataset as a `.zip` file from Kaggle (you need a free Kaggle account to be able to download the file). \n",
        "\n",
        "**If you do download the `.zip` file yourself, or use a different dataset, be sure to upload the dataset `.zip` file to the root directory, and rename the file: `dataset.zip`.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Local Development\n",
        "This notebook uses a multitude of different packages, libraries and dependencies to make all the code in this notebook work. The repo contains two dependency files that you may use to get your development environment up and running. One for conda development environments `environment.yaml`, and one Python file for used in all development environments `requirements.txt`. The dependency files can be found in the Github [repo](https://github.com/krullmizter/dog-breed-id-fastai/tree/main/venv).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python dependencies are needed for both local development and everywhere else, like Conda, Google Colab, VS Code, Kaggle, and so on. The Python dependencies will be installed automatically in the **Installs & Imports** chapter using `pip`.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you run this notebook locally, I recommend using Jupyter Notebook like [Anaconda notebooks](https://anaconda.org/) and running the notebook with administrative privileges. The base Anaconda `environment.yaml` dependencies are only needed if your work with an conda environment. If you choose to do local development with anaconda begin by creating a new conda environment and load the needed dependencies from the terminal. \n",
        "\n",
        "**The conda dependencies (environment.yaml) are different from the pip (requirements.txt)!**:\n",
        "\n",
        "You need to be located in the directory of the `environment.yaml` to do this:\n",
        "`conda env create -f environment.yaml` \n",
        "\n",
        "You can also create a new conda environment using the GUI called Anaconda navigator. You can then import the `environment.yaml` file into your Anaconda navigator.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Errors\n",
        "`PackagesNotFoundError`\n",
        "\n",
        "If your conda installation can't find a certain package to download, then a tip is to use the dependency name, and the `-c` flag to specify from what channel you wish to download the dependency from:\n",
        "\n",
        "`conda install fastai pytorch pytorch-cuda -c fastai -c pytorch -c nvidia`\n",
        "\n",
        "### Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want an easy way to run this notebook, use cloud-hosted GPUs, and have an easy time with dependencies and packages, then I recommend [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). To get started upload the `main.ipynb` to Colab. You can also clone my repo, and upload it to your GitHub and load your own repo to Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Training Folder\n",
        "When you run the `main.ipynb` file, with either the `export_model` or `log` variable set to true in the settings cell, a directory called `trained` will be created, in the root folder. It will hold a `.json` file with the stats of the model's training since its first successful training run. This way, one can view the past training stats to help with tweaking the model further. The directory will also hold the exported trained model as a `.pkl` file. It will also hold the exported .pkl file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### My Development\n",
        "\n",
        "My training was computed locally on an RTX-3070 GPU using Anaconda, and online via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The main software and libraries I used (specified versions are not required):\n",
        "* Anaconda (1.11.1)\n",
        "    * Conda (23.3.1)\n",
